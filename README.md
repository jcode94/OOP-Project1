# Basic Personnel Management Program
**Authors: Justice Smith, Taylor Andrew**

**Overview:**

- Menu-based student/faculty/staff database management system

- Single file as requirement for assignment.

- Instantiates students, faculty, and staff as objects added to ArrayLists
  to manage the collection and output of information based on menu selection. 
  
- Supports some input validation(Menu, Department/Rank/Status).

- Protects(asks user for confirmation)active student data from overwrite.

*I plan to separate all classes after the assignment is submitted, for future clarity. --JS*
